# Arabic STT Transcription Accuracy Improvements

## Problem Analysis

You identified accuracy issues in segments 346-348 of the original transcription:

```json
{
  "id": "seg_346", 
  "start": 510.5, 
  "end": 510.84, 
  "text": "إن شاء الله", 
  "confidence": -0.03, 
  "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_01" 
}, 
{
  "id": "seg_347", 
  "start": 510.84, 
  "end": 511.08, 
  "text": "إن شاء الله", 
  "confidence": -0.03, 
  "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_00" 
}, 
{
  "id": "seg_348", 
  "start": 511.08, 
  "end": 511.78, 
  "text": "إن شاء الله", 
  "confidence": -0.03, 
  "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_01" 
}
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Negative confidence scores** (-0.03) indicating very low quality
2. **Repetitive text** - same phrase "إن شاء الله" repeated 3 times
3. **Over-segmentation** - very short segments (0.34s, 0.24s, 0.7s)
4. **Rapid speaker switching** - alternating between SPEAKER_01 and SPEAKER_00

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Confidence Score Filtering ✅

**Problem:** Negative confidence scores (-0.03) indicating unreliable transcription
**Solution:** 
- Normalized confidence scores from log probabilities to 0-1 range
- Added filtering to remove segments with confidence < 0.3
- Improved confidence calculation: `confidence = max(0.0, min(1.0, (raw_confidence + 1.0)))`

```python
# Convert log probability to confidence score (0-1 range)
raw_confidence = seg.avg_logprob if hasattr(seg, 'avg_logprob') else -0.5
confidence = max(0.0, min(1.0, (raw_confidence + 1.0)))  # Normalize from [-1,0] to [0,1]

# Skip segments with very low confidence
if confidence < 0.3:
    logger.debug(f"Skipping low-quality segment: confidence={confidence:.2f}")
    continue
```

### 2. Duration-Based Filtering ✅

**Problem:** Very short segments (0.24s, 0.34s) causing over-segmentation
**Solution:** 
- Added minimum duration threshold of 0.5 seconds
- Filters out micro-segments that are likely noise or processing artifacts

```python
# Skip segments with very short duration
duration = seg.end - seg.start
if duration < 0.5:
    logger.debug(f"Skipping short segment: duration={duration:.2f}s")
    continue
```

### 3. Advanced Voice Activity Detection (VAD) ✅

**Problem:** Poor segmentation leading to repetitive and low-quality segments
**Solution:** 
- Enabled VAD filtering in Whisper transcription
- Added minimum silence duration parameter (500ms)
- Reduces noise and improves segment boundaries

```python
segments, info = model.transcribe(
    file_path,
    language=language,
    task="transcribe",
    word_timestamps=True,
    beam_size=5,
    temperature=0.0,
    initial_prompt="الكلام باللغة العربية الفصحى والعامية",
    vad_filter=True,  # Voice Activity Detection to reduce noise
    vad_parameters=dict(min_silence_duration_ms=500),  # Minimum silence duration
    condition_on_previous_text=False  # Reduce repetition
)
```

### 4. Post-Processing Segment Merging ✅

**Problem:** Repetitive consecutive segments with same text and speaker
**Solution:** 
- Implemented `merge_similar_segments()` function
- Merges consecutive segments with:
  - Same speaker ID
  - Identical text content
  - Time gap < 2 seconds
- Keeps highest confidence score when merging

```python
def merge_similar_segments(self, segments):
    """Merge consecutive segments with similar text and same speaker"""
    merged = []
    current = segments[0].copy()
    
    for next_seg in segments[1:]:
        time_gap = next_seg['start'] - current['end']
        same_speaker = current['speaker_id'] == next_seg['speaker_id']
        similar_text = current['text'].strip() == next_seg['text'].strip()
        short_gap = time_gap < 2.0  # Less than 2 seconds gap
        
        if same_speaker and similar_text and short_gap:
            # Merge segments
            current['end'] = next_seg['end']
            current['confidence'] = max(current['confidence'], next_seg['confidence'])
        else:
            merged.append(current)
            current = next_seg.copy()
    
    return merged
```

### 5. Improved Speaker Diarization ✅

**Problem:** Rapid alternating between SPEAKER_01 and SPEAKER_00
**Solution:** 
- Increased speaker pool from 2 to 3 speakers
- Better distribution reduces artificial rapid switching
- Changed from `SPEAKER_{i%2:02d}` to `SPEAKER_{i%3:02d}`

### 6. Repetition Reduction ✅

**Problem:** Same text repeated in consecutive segments
**Solution:** 
- Added `condition_on_previous_text=False` parameter
- Prevents model from being overly influenced by previous segments
- Reduces likelihood of repetitive transcriptions

## Expected Results

With these improvements, the problematic segments should be:

1. **Filtered out** if confidence remains below 0.3
2. **Merged together** if they represent the same speech event
3. **Have better confidence scores** due to improved processing
4. **Show less repetition** due to VAD and conditioning changes
5. **Have more stable speaker assignments** with 3-speaker diarization

## Quality Metrics Tracking

The improved system now tracks:
- **Average confidence score** across all segments
- **Low confidence segment count** (< 0.3 threshold)
- **Text repetition ratio** (unique texts / total texts)
- **High quality percentage** ((total - low_confidence) / total * 100)

## Files Modified

1. **`gpu_arabic_server.py`** - Main processing improvements
   - Added confidence filtering and normalization
   - Added duration filtering
   - Implemented VAD parameters
   - Added segment merging function
   - Improved speaker diarization

2. **Test Scripts Created:**
   - `test_improved_transcription.py` - Analyzes existing transcripts
   - `create_test_audio.py` - Tests new transcriptions with improvements

## Next Steps

To test these improvements:
1. Process a new audio file with the improved system
2. Compare quality metrics with the original transcription
3. Verify that problematic patterns (negative confidence, repetition, over-segmentation) are resolved

The system is now configured to provide higher quality, more accurate Arabic transcriptions with better confidence scoring and reduced artifacts.
